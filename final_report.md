## Why This Project Interests Us
Food is a universal language that brings people together, and all of us are passionate about exploring different cuisines from around the world. We wanted to create a platform that makes discovering authentic recipes from specific countries and regions both intuitive and exciting. 

Traditional recipe websites often rely on keyword searches or endless scrolling, which can feel limiting when you're craving something specific but don't know exactly what to search for. Our solution addresses this through two innovative features: an interactive global map that lets users visually explore recipes by geographic location, and AI-powered natural language search that understands queries like "show me spicy Korean dishes" or "what's a traditional Italian pasta from the south?" 

By combining geographic visualization with intelligent search, we're making it easier than ever to discover new dishes, explore culinary traditions, and connect with food cultures from every corner of the globe.
